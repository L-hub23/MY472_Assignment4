# MY472_Assignment4

This repository hosts the code for a research project centered around the question "What, if any, characteristics and factors discriminate MPs who tend to ask questions about economic issues from MPs who tend to ask questions about health and welfare issues?"

The research was conducted using data from the UK Parliament API, Wikipedia, data on constituency median wages provided by the House of Commons, and a dataset on the left-right alignment of MPs provided by Royal Holloway, University of London.

Both the Markdown and the HTML file contain the project report including all code.
